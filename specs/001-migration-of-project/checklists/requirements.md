# Requirements Quality Checklist: Constitution Compliance Migration

Created: 2025-10-14  
Feature: Constitution Compliance Migration (`001-migration-of-project`)  
Depth: Standard (PR Reviewer)  
Focus Areas: Test Path Mirroring, Dead/Duplicate Code Elimination, Localized Error Handling, Determinism, Coverage & Quality Gates

## Requirement Completeness
- [ ] CHK001 Are relocation requirements documented for ALL existing legacy test category folders (`tests/release_notes`, `tests/data`, `tests/model`, `tests/utils`)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 Are rules defined for handling source files that currently have NO unit test (placeholder import tests)? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements specified for consolidating duplicate formatting logic (scope & target modules)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK004 Are explicit removal actions defined for each dead code candidate (function, method) including criteria? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Is a coverage retention/improvement strategy defined (≥90% target) rather than merely stated? [Gap, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Clarity
- [ ] CHK006 Is "100% test path compliance" clearly quantified (audit algorithm, path pattern)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK007 Are "duplicate logic segments" precisely identified (hashing/signature method or file list)? [Gap, Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the definition of "unused" function/method (no imports? zero call sites? tooling criteria) documented? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK009 Are conditions that distinguish fatal vs recoverable errors explicitly outlined? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK010 Is determinism measurement (output hash algorithm or comparison criteria) defined? [Gap, Clarity, Spec §SC-006]

## Requirement Consistency
- [ ] CHK011 Do coverage targets (≥90%) align with success criteria and not contradict existing baseline mention? [Consistency, Spec §FR-006, §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK012 Are lint score goals (≥9.95) consistent between functional requirements and success criteria? [Consistency, Spec §FR-007, §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK013 Does error handling approach avoid conflict between localized handling and entry-point fatal exceptions? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK014 Are test path mirroring rules consistent with edge case placeholder test requirement? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001, §Edge Cases]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality / Measurability
- [ ] CHK015 Can test path compliance be objectively measured (numeric ratio mirrored/total == 1.0)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK016 Can duplicate-code elimination be validated by zero lint duplicate-code warnings? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK017 Can dead code removal be verified by an empty DeadCodeCandidate list and stable/improved coverage %? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK018 Are localized error handling outcomes measurable (count of logged ErrorHandlingEvent vs raw exceptions)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-005]
- [ ] CHK019 Is determinism validated by identical output hash over two successive runs? [Measurability, Spec §SC-006]

## Scenario Coverage
- [ ] CHK020 Are migration scenarios covered for each legacy folder (single file move, multi-file merge, nested path)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK021 Are negative scenarios defined (missing mirrored test, failed relocation, conflicting names)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are recovery scenarios covered (rollback plan if coverage drops or consolidation breaks formatting)? [Gap, Coverage]
- [ ] CHK023 Are exception scenarios for miner/builder failures documented with outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK024 Are new module addition scenarios explicitly addressed (auto placeholder test creation)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage
- [ ] CHK025 Are naming collisions between two legacy tests for same source file addressed (merge rule)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK026 Are extremely deep source paths considered for mirroring feasibility (path length constraints)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK027 Is handling of source files intentionally excluded from testing (generated code?) defined? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK028 Are partial formatting failures (single record row fails) covered by localized handling description? [Edge Case, Spec §User Story 3]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] CHK029 Is performance impact of path audit & duplicate scan addressed (acceptable runtime bounds)? [Gap, NFR]
- [ ] CHK030 Are logging verbosity expectations defined for migration tasks (levels, filtering)? [NFR, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK031 Is tooling extensibility (future audit integration into CI) documented? [Gap, NFR]

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [ ] CHK032 Are assumptions about existing tooling (pylint duplicate-code, coverage tool availability) documented? [Assumption, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK033 Are external dependencies (GitHub API calls during integration tests) isolated from migration success criteria? [Dependency, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK034 Is assumption that no public API changes are needed validated (inventory performed)? [Assumption, Spec §FR-009]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts
- [ ] CHK035 Is ambiguity around "single reusable function" scope (builder vs record vs utils) resolved? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK036 Are potential conflicts between consolidation and existing specialized formatting cases addressed? [Conflict, Gap]
- [ ] CHK037 Is ambiguity in error severity classification (warn vs error vs fatal) clarified? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 3]

## Traceability & Governance
- [ ] CHK038 Are requirement IDs (FR-/SC-) consistently referenced in tasks/plans for migration? [Traceability, Spec §FR-* §SC-*]
- [ ] CHK039 Is there a defined mapping from each success criterion to at least one automated check? [Traceability, Gap]
- [ ] CHK040 Are removal decisions documented with references to diff/commit or issue IDs? [Traceability, Spec §FR-010]

## Completeness of Definitions
- [ ] CHK041 Is a formal definition for "mirrored path" included (regex or pattern spec)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK042 Is a definition for "dead code" beyond narrative provided (static analysis rule set)? [Gap]

## Quality Gate Alignment
- [ ] CHK043 Do requirements specify how to fail the build on path audit or dead code detection? [Gap, Consistency]
- [ ] CHK044 Are gating order and precedence (formatting before path audit?) documented? [Gap]

## Risk & Mitigation
- [ ] CHK045 Are risks of accidental test loss during relocation documented with mitigation steps (git move strategy)? [Risk, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK046 Is rollback plan defined if consolidation introduces subtle output regression (snapshot compare)? [Risk, Gap]

## Final Validation Readiness
- [ ] CHK047 Does the spec enable building an automated audit script without needing further clarifications? [Readiness]
- [ ] CHK048 Are all placeholders removed (no [FEATURE NAME], [DATE], generic examples) ensuring production-ready spec? [Readiness]
- [ ] CHK049 Are measurable targets cross-referenced with tooling capabilities (coverage, lint, hashing)? [Readiness]
- [ ] CHK050 Is there explicit confirmation that no behavioral changes to release notes formatting are intended beyond consolidation? [Readiness, Spec §FR-003]
