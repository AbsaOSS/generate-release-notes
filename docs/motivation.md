# Motivation

Release documentation often drifts: missing PR summaries, unlabeled issues, or manual copy/paste errors right before a release. This Action was created to enforce **repeatable, label‚Äëdriven, metadata‚Äërich** release notes with minimal friction for contributors.

## Problems Addressed
- Manual release note curation is slow and error-prone.
- Inconsistent formatting across releases reduces readability.
- Orphaned work (issues without PRs / PRs without notes) goes unnoticed.
- Large epics or feature umbrellas are hard to summarize without hierarchy.
- AI (CodeRabbit) summaries are useful, but only as a fallback‚Äîmanual author intent stays primary.

## Design Principles
| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Determinism | Same inputs produce the same release notes; no hidden heuristics. |
| Explicit Configuration | Chapters defined in YAML; no magic label groupings. |
| Fail Safe | If explicit notes missing, optionally fall back to CodeRabbit; never silently fabricate content. |
| Transparency | Service Chapters surface hygiene issues instead of hiding them. |
| Extensibility | Row formats, hierarchy, and duplicity policy are pluggable via inputs. |
| Minimal Boilerplate | Only a tag and basic chapters required for first adoption. |

## Key Inputs Snapshot
(See full list in [Configuration Reference](configuration_reference.md).)

| Category | Inputs (examples) | Purpose |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Scope | `tag-name`, `from-tag-name`, `published-at` | Define time window. |
| Extraction | `release-notes-title`, `coderabbit-*` | Control where notes are sourced. |
| Filtering | `skip-release-notes-labels` | Exclude internal/noisy work. |
| Quality | `warnings`, `duplicity-scope`, `duplicity-icon` | Surface inconsistencies & handle duplicates. |
| Formatting | `chapters`, row-format inputs, `print-empty-chapters` | Control output layout & presence of empty headings. |
| Structure | `hierarchy` | Enable multi-level issue rollups. |
| Diagnostics | `verbose` | Aid debugging. |

## Outputs
| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `release-notes` | Single Markdown block containing user-defined chapters, optional Service Chapters, and a Full Changelog link. |

## Why Chapters?
Labels are already a ubiquitous classification mechanism. Mapping labels to chapter titles gives **controllable taxonomy** (marketing-friendly headings) while keeping developer workflow unchanged. Repeating a `title` with different `label` values aggregates multiple labels under the same heading (e.g., `bug` + `error` ‚Üí ‚ÄúBugfixes üõ†‚Äù).

## Why Service Chapters?
Instead of silently skipping incomplete metadata, the Action exposes structural gaps (e.g., unlabeled issues, merged PRs with open issues) so teams can tighten process over time.

## Why Duplicity Policy?
Some teams prefer a single canonical appearance per item; others want visibility across thematic chapters (e.g., ‚ÄúBreaking Changes‚Äù AND ‚ÄúNew Features‚Äù). The `duplicity-scope` input lets teams choose without forking logic.

## Why Hierarchy?
Complex efforts (epics) fragment across multiple issues/PRs. Hierarchical rendering bundles context and contributors while still allowing individual tracking.

## Why AI Fallback (Optional)?
AI summaries can fill gaps‚Äîbut only when authors forget to supply release notes. The Action never overrides explicit human-authored content.

## Lifecycle Summary
1. Resolve previous release and time window.
2. Fetch issues, PRs, commits.
3. Extract release notes (manual ‚Üí fallback AI if enabled).
4. Populate custom chapters (label ‚Üí title mapping).
5. Add Service Chapters (if `warnings: true`).
6. Emit final Markdown.
