# How to Contribute?

## **Identifying and Reporting Bugs**
* **Ensure the bug has not already been reported** by searching our **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/generate-release-notes/issues)**.
* If you cannot find an open issue describing the problem, use the **Bug report** template to open a new one. Tag it with the **bug** label.

## **Proposing New Features**

* **Check if the feature has already been requested** by searching through our **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/generate-release-notes/issues)**.
* If the feature request doesn't exist, feel free to create a new one. Tag it with the **request** label.

## **Contributing to Development**

* Check _Issues_ logs for the desired feature or bug. Ensure that no one else is already working on it.
    * If the feature/bug is not yet filed, please create a detailed issue first:
        * **"Detail Your Idea or Issue"**
* Fork the repository.
* Begin coding. Feel free to ask questions and collaborate with us.
    * Commit messages should reference the GitHub Issue and provide a concise description:
        * **"#34 Implement Feature X"**
    * Remember to include tests for your code.
* Once done, push to your fork and submit a Pull Request to our `master` branch:
    * Pull Request titles should begin with the GitHub Issue number:
        * **"45 Implementing New Analytics Feature"**
    * Ensure the Pull Request description clearly outlines your solution.
    * Link your PR to the relevant _Issue_.
