## Overview

**Release Notes Scrapper Action** scans issues, pull requests, and commits to create categorized release notes for your project releases.  
It groups changes by labels (e.g., “Bugfixes 🛠”, “New Features 🎉”) and extracts relevant content from PR descriptions or CodeRabbit summaries.

**Key Benefits**
- Fully automated release note generation
- Categorization by labels or issue hierarchy
- Built-in “Service Chapters” to detect missing or incomplete release notes
- Configurable templates and icons
- Smart duplicate detection

## Motivation

Good documentation isn’t optional — it’s your project’s memory.  
This Action was created to make structured release documentation effortless and consistent across teams.

👉 For the full background and design principles, see [docs/motivation.md](/docs/motivation.md)

## Quick Start

Add the following step to your workflow to start generating release notes.

```yaml
- name: Generate Release Notes
  id: release_notes_scrapper
  uses: AbsaOSS/generate-release-notes@v1
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  with:
    tag-name: "v1.2.0"
    chapters: |
      - {"title": "Breaking Changes 💥", "label": "breaking-change"}
      - {"title": "New Features 🎉", "label": "feature"}
      - {"title": "Bugfixes 🛠", "label": "bug"}
```

**Example output snippet:**

```markdown
### New Features 🎉
- #23 _Feature title_ author is @root assigned to @neo developed by @morpheus in #24
  - Added support for multi-factor authentication.

### Bugfixes 🛠
- PR: #25 _Copy not allowed_ author is @dependabot[bot] assigned to @smith developed by @smith
  - Handfull copy operation has been developed.

#### Full Changelog
https://github.com/org/repo/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0
```

**That’s it** — the Action will:

1. Fetch all closed issues and PRs from latest till now.
2. Categorize them by labels.
3. Extract release note text and contributors.
4. Output a Markdown section ready for publishing.

## Requirements

To run this action successfully, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

| Requirement                | Description                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Token**           | A GitHub token with permission to read issues, pull requests, and releases. Usually available as `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.  |
| **Python 3.11+**           | The action internally runs on Python 3.11 or higher. If you’re developing locally or testing, ensure this version is available.  |
| **Repository Permissions** | The action needs at least `read` access to issues and pull requests, and `write` access to create or update release drafts.      |
| **YAML Chapters Config**   | Each chapter must have a `title` and a `label`. Example: `{"title": "Bugfixes 🛠", "label": "bug"}`.                             |

## Configuration

Only a few inputs are required to get started:

| Name           | Description                                    | Required | Default |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token for authentication                | Yes      | -       |
| `tag-name`     | Target tag for the release                     | Yes      | -       |
| `chapters`     | List of chapters and labels for categorization | No       | -       |
| `verbose`      | Enable detailed logging                        | No       | false   |

For the full input and output reference, see [Configuration reference](docs/configuration_reference.md)

## Example Workflow

You can integrate this Action with your release process.

### Example — Manual Release Dispatch

```yaml
name: "Create Release & Notes"
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag-name:
        description: 'Name of git tag to be created, and then draft release created. Syntax: "v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+".'
        required: false

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Generate Release Notes
        id: notes
        uses: AbsaOSS/generate-release-notes@v1.0.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag-name: ${{ github.event.inputs.tag-name }}
          chapters: |
            - {"title": "New Features 🎉", "label": "enhancement"}
            - {"title": "Bugfixes 🛠", "label": "bug"}

      - name: Create Draft Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        with:
          name: ${{ github.event.inputs.tag-name }}
          tag_name: ${{ github.event.inputs.tag-name }}
          body: ${{ steps.notes.outputs.release_notes }}
          draft: true
```
