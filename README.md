  uses: AbsaOSS/generate-release-notes@v0.2.0
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  
  with:
    tag-name: "v0.2.0"
    from-tag-name: "v0.1.0"
    chapters: |
      - {"title": "Breaking Changes üí•", "label": "breaking-change"}

    warnings: false
    print-empty-chapters: false
```

## Features
### Built-in
#### Release Notes Extraction Process
This feature searches for release notes in the description of GitHub pull requests, making it easier for maintainers to track changes and updates.
- **Format:** 
  - The release notes section have to begin with the title `Release Notes:` (case-sensitive), followed by the release notes in bullet points. [Markdown formatting is supported](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#unordered-lists).
  - If no release notes line is detected under the `Release Notes:` title, no release notes will be printed in the output.
- **Example:** 
  - Here are examples of how to structure the release notes:
```
Release Notes:
- This update introduces a new caching mechanism that improves performance by 20%.

Release Notes:
* This update introduces a new caching mechanism that improves performance by 20%.

Release Notes:
+ This update introduces a new caching mechanism that improves performance by 20%.

```
The extraction process supports all three types of bullet points: `-`, `*`, and `+`, and their combinations. (GitHub documentation do not recommend to mix them.)

- **Best Practice:** Select one character from `-`, `*`, `+` for bullet points. The Markdown parser will automatically format them as a list.
- **Optional usage:** The release notes section is not mandatory for GH action to work.

#### Handling Multiple PRs
If an issue is linked to multiple PRs, the action fetches and aggregates contributions from all linked PRs.

### Select start date for closed issues and PRs
By set **published-at** to true the action will use the `published-at` timestamp of the latest release as the reference point for searching closed issues and PRs, instead of the `created-at` date. If first release, repository creation date is used. 

### Enable skipping of release notes for specific issues using label
By defining the `skip-release-notes-labels` option, the action will skip all issues and related PRs if they contain a label defined in configuration. This is useful for issues that are not relevant for release notes.

### Enable Service Chapters
If the `warnings` option is enabled in the action's configuration, the release notes will include sections that highlight possible issues.

The action includes four specific warning chapters to highlight potential areas of improvement in release documentation. Each chapter serves a distinct purpose:

- **_Closed Issues Without Pull Request_**
  - **Purpose**: This chapter lists issues that have been closed since the last release but are not linked to any pull requests.
  - **Importance**: Helps maintainers identify changes that might not have been properly reviewed or documented through PRs, ensuring the integrity of the release documentation.

- **_Closed Issues Without User-Defined Labels_**
  - **Purpose**: Displays issues lacking the labels defined in the `chapters` configuration.
  - **Importance**: Ensures all issues are categorized correctly according to the project's classification system. It aids in organizing release notes into predefined chapters effectively.

- **_Closed Issues Without Release Notes_**
  - **Purpose**: Identifies pull requests which do not contain a "Release Notes" section in description.
  - **Importance**: Ensures that all significant changes are properly documented in the release notes, enhancing the completeness and usefulness of the release information provided to end-users.

- **_Merged PRs Without Linked Issue_**
  - **Purpose**: Lists pull requests that are not associated with any issues.
  - **Importance**: Encourages linking PRs to issues for better traceability and understanding of why changes were made. It also helps in maintaining a cohesive narrative in the project history and release notes.

- **_Merged PRs Linked to Open Issue_**
  - **Purpose**: This section identifies merged pull requests that are still linked to issues which are open.
  - **Importance**: Highlighting these PRs indicates potential discrepancies or ongoing work related to the PR. It helps in ensuring that all issues addressed by PRs are properly closed and documented, maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the project's issue tracking.

- **_Closed PRs Without Linked Issue_**
  - **Purpose**: Lists pull requests that are closed (not merged) but not associated with any issues.
  - **Importance**: Highlighting closed PRs without linked issues ensures transparency in the project's history. It helps track important decisions and clarifies the reasoning behind changes, even if they aren't merged. This practice enhances the project's documentation quality and aids in understanding its evolution.

- **_Others - No Topic_**
  - **Purpose**: This chapter lists issues that do not fall into any of the predefined chapters.
  - **Importance**: Helps maintainers identify issues that may not have been categorized correctly. This ensures that all issues are properly documented and organized in the release notes.

Each warning chapter acts as a quality check, ensuring that the release notes are comprehensive, well-organized, and meaningful. By addressing these warnings, project maintainers can significantly improve the clarity and effectiveness of their release documentation.


### Showing Duplicity Lines In Chapters
By setting the `duplicity-scope` with one of the options, the action will show whether the duplicity issue lines are correct.
- `custom`: will show duplicity lines only in custom chapters.
- `service`: will show duplicity lines only in service chapters.
- `both`: will show duplicity lines in both custom and service chapters.
- `none`: will hide duplicity lines in all chapters.

Duplicity lines in `custom` chapters can point to potential issues with wrong labeling. In contrast, duplicity lines in `service` chapters can help maintainers identify areas with the most significant problems to address.

By setting `duplicity-icon` you can customize the icon used to indicate duplicity issue lines in the release notes. Icon will be placed at the beginning of the line. The duplicity icon is visible from **second** occurrence of the issue in the selected scope.

### Define "From Tag" Name
By setting the `from-tag-name` option, the action will generate release notes from the specified tag to the tag defined in the `tag-name` option. This feature is helpful for generating release notes for a specific range of tags.

The final interval is time-based. The `published-at` or `created-at` timestamp of the previous release or repository creation date, if it is the first release, is used as the starting point. The previous release is determined to be the previous semantic version tag.

## Get Started

```

## Running Static Code Analysis

This project uses Pylint tool for static code analysis. Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces, coding standards, looks for code smells etc.

Pylint displays a global evaluation score for the code, rated out of a maximum score of 10.0. We are aiming to keep our code quality high above the score 9.5.

### Set Up Python Environment
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will also install a Pylint tool, since it is listed in the project requirements.

### Run Pylint
Run Pylint on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.
```shell
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Pylint on a specific file, follow the pattern `pylint <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:
```shell
pylint release-notes-generator/generator.py
``` 

## Run Black Tool Locally
This project uses the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) tool for code formatting.
Black aims for consistency, generality, readability and reducing git diffs.
The coding style used can be viewed as a strict subset of PEP 8.

The project root file `pyproject.toml` defines the Black tool configuration.
In this project we are accepting the line length of 120 characters.

Follow these steps to format your code with Black locally:

### Set Up Python Environment
From terminal in the root of the project, run the following command:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will also install a Black tool, since it is listed in the project requirements.

### Run Black
Run Black on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.
```shell
black $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Black on a specific file, follow the pattern `black <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:
```shell
black release_notes_generator/generator.py
``` 

### Expected Output
This is the console expected output example after running the tool:
```
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted.
```


## Running Unit Test

Unit tests are written using pytest. To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
pytest tests/
```

This will execute all tests located in the tests directory.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is collected using pytest-cov coverage tool. To run the tests and collect coverage information, use the following command:

```shell
pytest --cov=. -v tests/ --cov-fail-under=80
```

This will execute all tests located in the tests directory and generate a code coverage report.

See the coverage report on the path:

```shell
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## GitHub Workflow Examples
GitHub Actions enable automating key parts of your development process.

### Create Release Tag & Draft Release - By Workflow Dispatch
This workflow automates the creation of a release tag and a draft release, triggered manually via a workflow dispatch.
Tag is created after successful release notes generation to avoid manual removing of the tag if the release notes are not generated due to wrong configuration.

See the [example of workflow](./examples/release_draft.yml).

#### Impact to Users
The users can trigger the workflow manually by clicking the "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab. The workflow will create a release tag and a draft release based on the release notes generated by the action.

This workflow replaces the manual process of creating a release tag and draft release, saving time and ensuring consistency in the release process.

### Check Release Notes Presence - in Pull Request Description 
This workflow checks that every pull request includes release notes in the description.

See the [example of workflow](./examples/check_pr_release_notes.yml).

#### Impact to Users
The users are expected to provide the release notes in the pull request body. See example:
```markdown
Release Notes:                          .... also valid: ## Release Notes:
- 1st line of PR's release notes
- 2nd line of PR's release notes
```

This section can be placed anywhere in the pull request body. The action will search for the release notes based on the provided title text. _Hint:_ The title can be chapter name, the Markdown format tags are ignored.

## FAQs
### Why is in generated Release Notes content mentioned co-author without link to his GitHub account?
Co-authors can be added into a commit message by using the `Co-authored-by` trailer in the commit message. This trailer is used by GitHub to link the commit to the co-author's GitHub account. The co-author's name is mentioned in the generated Release Notes without a link to his GitHub account.
```
Co-authored-by: NAME <NAME@EXAMPLE.COM>
```
The Release Notes generator is trying to get Github user by call GitHub API with the co-author's email address. If the user is found, the generator will use the user's name and link to his GitHub account. If the user is not found, the generator will use the co-author's name without a link to his GitHub account.
This leads to the situation when the co-author's name is mentioned in the generated Release Notes without a link to his GitHub account.

### Will the action provide duplicate line in chapters if the issue contains multiple labels?
Let's imagine that we have an issue which has three labels: `enhancement`, `feature`, `bug`.
We defined chapters for our GH actions this way:
```
    chapters: '[
      {"title": "Breaking Changes üí•", "label": "breaking-change"},
      {"title": "New Features üéâ", "label": "enhancement"},
      {"title": "New Features üéâ", "label": "feature"},
      {"title": "Bugfixes üõ†", "label": "bug"}
    ]'
```
Then in chapters `New Features üéâ` and `Bugfixes üõ†` will be duplicated lines for this issue. When mentioned second+ times then **[Duplicate]** prefix will be visible.
In the `New Features üéâ` chapter will be mentioned this issue once only.

### What will happen when the pull request contains multiple "Release Notes" sections?
Only the first one will be used.

### What will happen when Merged PR is linked to open issues?
The PR will be mentioned in warning chapter **Merged PRs Linked to Open Issue**.
