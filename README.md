## Features
### Built-in
#### Release Notes Extraction Process

This action requires that your GitHub issues include comments with specific release notes. Here's how it works:

**Extraction Method**:
- The action scans through comments on each closed issue since the last release. It identifies comments that follow the specified format and extracts the content as part of the release notes.
- The time considered for the previous release is based on its creation time. This means that the action will look for issues closed after the creation time of the most recent release to ensure that all relevant updates since that release are included.

**Comment Format**
- For an issue's contributions to be included in the release notes, it must contain a comment starting with "Release Notes" followed by the note content. This comment is typically added by the contributors.
- Here is an example of the content for a 'Release Notes' string, which is not case-sensitive:
```
Release Notes
- This update introduces a new caching mechanism that improves performance by 20%.
```
- Using `-` as a bullet point for each note is the best practice. The Markdown parser will automatically convert it to a list.
- These comments are not required for action functionality. If an issue does not contain a "Release Notes" comment, it will be marked accordingly in the release notes. This helps maintainers quickly identify which issues need attention for documentation.

#### Contributors Mention
Along with the release note content, the action also gathers a list of contributors for each issue. This includes issue assignees and authors of linked pull requests' commits, providing acknowledgment for their contributions in the release notes.

#### Handling Multiple PRs
If an issue is linked to multiple PRs, the action fetches and aggregates contributions from all linked PRs.

#### No Release Notes Found
If no valid "Release Notes" comment is found in an issue, it will be marked accordingly. This helps maintainers quickly identify which issues need attention for documentation.

#### Row formatting
Format of the row for the issue and PR in the release notes can be customized. The placeholders are case-sensitive.

**Supported row format keywords:**
- `{number}`: Issue or PR number.
- `{title}`: Issue or PR title.
- `{pull-requests}`: List of PRs linked to the issue. Adds a list of PRs linked to the issue in the row with `in` prefix:
  - `#{number} _{title}_ {pull-requests}` => "[#43]() _title_ in [#PR1](), [#PR2](), [#PR3]()"
  - Not used in PR row format. See default value. 

### Select start date for closed issues and PRs
By set **published-at** to true the action will use the `published-at` timestamp of the latest release as the reference point for searching closed issues and PRs, instead of the `created-at` date. If first release, repository creation date is used. 

### Enable skipping of release notes for specific issues using label
By set **skip-release-notes-label** to true the action will skip all issues and related PRs if they contain a label defined in configuration. This is useful for issues that are not relevant for release notes.

### Enable Service Chapters
If the `warnings` option is enabled in the action's configuration, the release notes will include sections that highlight possible issues.

The action includes four specific warning chapters to highlight potential areas of improvement in release documentation. Each chapter serves a distinct purpose:

- **_Closed Issues Without Pull Request_**
  - **Purpose**: This chapter lists issues that have been closed since the last release but are not linked to any pull requests.
  - **Importance**: Helps maintainers identify changes that might not have been properly reviewed or documented through PRs, ensuring the integrity of the release documentation.

- **_Closed Issues Without User-Defined Labels_**
  - **Purpose**: Displays issues lacking the labels defined in the `chapters` configuration.
  - **Importance**: Ensures all issues are categorized correctly according to the project's classification system. It aids in organizing release notes into predefined chapters effectively.

- **_Closed Issues Without Release Notes_**
  - **Purpose**: Identifies issues that do not contain a "Release Notes" comment.
  - **Importance**: Ensures that all significant changes are properly documented in the release notes, enhancing the completeness and usefulness of the release information provided to end-users.

- **_Merged PRs Without Linked Issue_**
  - **Purpose**: Lists pull requests that are not associated with any issues.
  - **Importance**: Encourages linking PRs to issues for better traceability and understanding of why changes were made. It also helps in maintaining a cohesive narrative in the project history and release notes.

- **_Merged PRs Linked to Open Issue_**
  - **Purpose**: This section identifies merged pull requests that are still linked to issues which are open.
  - **Importance**: Highlighting these PRs indicates potential discrepancies or ongoing work related to the PR. It helps in ensuring that all issues addressed by PRs are properly closed and documented, maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the project's issue tracking.

- **_Closed PRs Without Linked Issue_**
  - **Purpose**: Lists pull requests that are closed (not merged) but not associated with any issues.
  - **Importance**: Highlighting closed PRs without linked issues ensures transparency in the project's history. It helps track important decisions and clarifies the reasoning behind changes, even if they aren't merged. This practice enhances the project's documentation quality and aids in understanding its evolution.

- **_Others - No Topic_**
  - **Purpose**: This chapter lists issues that do not fall into any of the predefined chapters.
  - **Importance**: Helps maintainers identify issues that may not have been categorized correctly. This ensures that all issues are properly documented and organized in the release notes.

Each warning chapter acts as a quality check, ensuring that the release notes are comprehensive, well-organized, and meaningful. By addressing these warnings, project maintainers can significantly improve the clarity and effectiveness of their release documentation.


### Showing Duplicity Lines In Chapters
By setting the `duplicity-scope` with one of the options, the action will show whether the duplicity issue lines are correct.
- `custom`: will show duplicity lines only in custom chapters.
- `service`: will show duplicity lines only in service chapters.
- `both`: will show duplicity lines in both custom and service chapters.
- `none`: will hide duplicity lines in all chapters.

Duplicity lines in `custom` chapters can point to potential issues with wrong labeling. In contrast, duplicity lines in `service` chapters can help maintainers identify areas with the most significant problems to address.

By setting `duplicity-icon` you can customize the icon used to indicate duplicity issue lines in the release notes. Icon will be placed at the beginning of the line. The duplicity icon is visible from **second** occurrence of the issue in the selected scope.

## FAQs
### Why is in generated Release Notes content mentioned co-author without link to his GitHub account?
Co-authors can be added into a commit message by using the `Co-authored-by` trailer in the commit message. This trailer is used by GitHub to link the commit to the co-author's GitHub account. The co-author's name is mentioned in the generated Release Notes without a link to his GitHub account.
```
Co-authored-by: NAME <NAME@EXAMPLE.COM>
```
The Release Notes generator is trying to get Github user by call GitHub API with the co-author's email address. If the user is found, the generator will use the user's name and link to his GitHub account. If the user is not found, the generator will use the co-author's name without a link to his GitHub account.
This leads to the situation when the co-author's name is mentioned in the generated Release Notes without a link to his GitHub account.

### Will the action provide duplicate line in chapters if the issue contains multiple labels?
Let's imagine that we have an issue which has three labels: `enhancement`, `feature`, `bug`.
We defined chapters for our GH actions this way:
```
    chapters: '[
      {"title": "Breaking Changes üí•", "label": "breaking-change"},
      {"title": "New Features üéâ", "label": "enhancement"},
      {"title": "New Features üéâ", "label": "feature"},
      {"title": "Bugfixes üõ†", "label": "bug"}
    ]'
```
Then in chapters `New Features üéâ` and `Bugfixes üõ†` will be duplicated lines for this issue. When mentioned second+ times then **[Duplicate]** prefix will be visible.
In the `New Features üéâ` chapter will be mentioned this issue once only.

### What will happen when the issue contains multiple "Release Notes" comments?
All issue comments are checked for presence of `Release Notes` string. All detected release notes are collected printed under issue.

### What will happen when Merged PR is linked to open issues?
The PR will be mentioned in warning chapter **Merged PRs Linked to Open Issue**.
